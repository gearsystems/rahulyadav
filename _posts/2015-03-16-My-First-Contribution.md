As a designer for GEAR Systems, My role involved learning new technologies added to the image and graphics development skill that I already possessed. I asked Sudheesh for help and he helped me by taking me to Anjaneyulu sir and requested for a book on JavaScript which he handed over to me. JavaScript is one of the most widely used technologies in the application modules that are being built at GEAR Systems.

I learnt a lot of new technologies for this purpose and also helped brainstorm during the regular team meetings, I've worked on the platform's web interfaces and added all the design and image content that is being used throughout the application.

At the same time, I've given time to learn more about loops and other data structures thats being used in the application, this is also a part of the main code that's potentially going to be used. I've had the first hand experience of attaching an open source patch.
